Java Syntax Standards
=====================

The development team will follow the Google set of coding standards for Java source code.

The complete set of Google standards are defined in the Google Java Style Guide, which can be found online at:

https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html

To install the Google styles in Eclipse:

* Download the eclipse-java-google-style.xml file from the http://code.google.com/p/google-styleguide/ repo. 
* Under Window/Preferences select Java/Code Style/Formatter. 
* Import the settings file by selecting Import.

Also note that the build generates a CheckStyle report. For a detailed breakdown of CheckStyle rules, please
refer to: http://checkstyle.sourceforge.net/checks.html
