CSS Syntax Standards
====================

Encoding of CSS files should be set to UTF-8.

Naming Conventions
------------------
Always use hyphens in class names. Do not use underscores or CamelCase notation.

Values
------
If you use 0 as a value, do not add a unit (px, em, etc.) after it.

Multiple selectors
------------------
Multiple selectors should each be on a single line, with no space after each comma.

Properties
----------
Every declaration should be on its own line below the opening brace. Each property should:

* have a single sof tab with 2 spaces before the property name and a single space before the property value.
* end in a semi-colon.

Shorthand properties
--------------------
Use shorthand properties when possible.
