Test Automation
===============

BDD and Automation
------------------

Test automation will form a core component of the broader test strategy for the project. Through automation the team is able to 
ensure a more consistent and robust system. Additionally, properly automated tests will enable faster deployment cycles with fewer 
accidental errors caused by hot-fixes made under pressure.

The test framework to be employed on the project uses the BDD paradigm.

For additional information on BDD, please refer to: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development

For our purposes, the BDD approach to development gives us:

* A formalised and rigorous language for defining system requirements in business-friendly language
* Explicit traceability between user requirenments and test scenarios 
* Industry standard tools for test automation
* Industry standard tools for test reporting
* Ability to hook the test process into our broader build and deployment pipeline

Our BDD testing toolchain is 100% open source and consists of:

* Cucumber for Java
* Selenium
* JMeter
* Serenity BDD
