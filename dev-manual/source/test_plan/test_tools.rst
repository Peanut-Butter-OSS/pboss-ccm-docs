Testing Tools and Software
==========================

A number of testing tools have been identified and will be used by the project team as part of the project's testing strategy. 
The selection of the testing tools/software was based on the current industry best practise, to ensure that the project testing 
complies with current accepted standards in software testing.

**Cucumber**

Cucumber is a software testing tool based on a Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) framework, which is used to write 
acceptance tests for the web application. It allows automation of functional validation in easily readable
and understandable format (like plain English) for Business Analysts, Developers and Testers.

For more details, please refer to https://cucumber.io/

**Serenity**

Serenity BDD allows testers to write cleaner and more maintainable automated acceptance and regression tests faster.
It also uses the test results to produce illustrated, narrative reports that document and describe what the application does
and how it works. It provides information both on what tests have been executed, and more importantly, what requirements have been tested.

**Selenium**

Selenium is a portable software-testing framework for web applications. It provides a playback (formerly also recording) tool for 
authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language (Selenium IDE). It also provides a test domain-specific 
language (Selenese) to write tests in a number of popular programming languages, including C#, Groovy, Java, Perl, PHP, Python, Ruby and Scala. 
The tests can then run against most modern web browsers.

**Apache JMeter**

Apache JMeter is an Apache project that can be used as a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services,
with a focus on web applications. JMeter can be used as a unit-test tool for JDBC database connections, FTP, LDAP, Webservices, 
JMS, HTTP, generic TCP connections and OS native processes.
