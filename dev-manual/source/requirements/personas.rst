Personas
========

Definition
----------
A persona defines an archetypical user of a system, an example of the kind of person who would interact with it. 
In other words, personas represent fictitious people which are based on our knowledge of real users. 

The personas have been defined in such a way to ensure that there is a suitable persona to cover all the 
Acceptance Criteria scenarios for the User Stories. Therefore, although the aim was to keep personas as 
close to the real world (and real users) as possible, in some cases a defined persona may not 100% align 
with reality, due to the above requirement.
